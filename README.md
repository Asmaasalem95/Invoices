Billie Mission 2120
====
​
Your Mission
-----
​
One of the fundamental problems of space missions is the time synchronization between Earth
and Space. The time on Mars and Earth is ticking differently and it is necessary to keep it under
control.
​
You need to write a microservice that we will install on our spaceships, satellites and in the
Billie Mars office in 2120.
​
The microservice should receive the time on Earth in UTC as an input and return two values:
the Mars Sol Date (MSD) and the Martian Coordinated Time (MTC).
​
You can use any PHP framework but don’t forget to cover it by tests, because we don’t want
our astronauts’ lives to depend on something untested.

Instructions
-----
​
1. Use this unzipped folder as a git repository. Please commit your code to it.
2. Separate the framework initalization code from your own code in different commits.
3. Once you are done, compress again the project (including the `.git` folder) into a zip file.
4. Follow the link provided by in the email to submit the zip for our engineers to review.

Review Criteria
---
​
We expect that the assignment will not take more than 3 hours of coding work. 
In our judgement we rely on common sense and do not expect over-engineered solutions.
We are rather insterested in your problem solving skills, your command of the programming language 
and choices of framework: readability, design patterns, best practices, community standards, runability, etc.
​
It's an oportunity for you to show us all you can do.
​
__General criteria__:
​
1. Task requirements are met.
2. Code is readable and comprehensible.
3. Setup instructions and run instructions are provided.
4. Tests are showcased.
5. Supporting notes on your decisions, clarifications, and potential improvements on the project are welcome.

Good luck and have fun!
